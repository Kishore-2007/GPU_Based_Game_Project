## Game Description: Tic-Tac-Toe

1. Introduction
                Tic-Tac-Toe, also known as Noughts and Crosses (O and X), is a two-player strategy game played on a simple 3×3 grid. Despite its simplicity, it demonstrates fundamental concepts of game theory, strategy optimization, and decision-making. It is widely used in computer science as a beginner’s example of algorithms such as minimax and game tree search.

3. Objective of the Game
   
    The main goal is:
    
    -To place three of your marks (X or O) in a row on the grid.
    
    -The row can be horizontal, vertical, or diagonal.
    
    -If all 9 cells are filled without either player achieving three in a row, the game ends in a draw.

4. Rules of Play
   
     -The game board is a 3×3 square grid (9 cells).
      
     -Two players take turns:
      
     -Player 1 usually uses X.
      
     -Player 2 usually uses O.
      
     -On each turn, a player places their mark in an empty cell.
      
     -The first player to form a line of three marks (row, column, or diagonal) wins the game.

     -If all cells are filled and no player has formed a winning line, the result is a draw.
